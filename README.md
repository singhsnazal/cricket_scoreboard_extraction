# Cricket Ball Clip Viewer

This is a Streamlit app to browse per-ball cricket clips (4s, 6s, etc.) using a JSON log file.

## How it works:
- Parses the `ball_clips_log.json`
- Shows runs like 1, 2, 4, 6, dot balls
- Allows you to view each delivery video

## Deployment
Push this to GitHub and deploy on https://streamlit.io
